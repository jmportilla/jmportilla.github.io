<h1>Spotify Artist Network Graph</h1>
 
<p>
  The following graph was created with the Spotify API.<br> As the graph loads, hold your click down and drag to remove the edges to allow clustering to occur faster. <br>
  You can also zoom in and out, drag nodes to pull their connections, and click a node to highlight its connections. Enjoy!
